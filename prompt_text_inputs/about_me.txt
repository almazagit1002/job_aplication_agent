I am a curious person with a diverse set of hobbies, including yoga, salsa dancing, and 
rock climbing, reflecting my passion for physical and mental well-being. Beyond these 
activities, I am an avid learner and voracious reader, and I find joy in expanding my 
knowledge. Traveling and immersing myself in different cultures has been an integral 
part of my life, I have spent the last 11 years residing in various European cities 
including London, Glasgow, Krakow and Copenhagen. This time has not only 
broadened my perspectives but has also enriched my adaptability and appreciation 
for diversity.
