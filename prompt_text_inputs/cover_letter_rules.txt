Know who you’re sending it to.
Who is going to read your cover letter? Is it the editor or manager of the company? Using their name in your introduction makes the letter feel more personal to them. People love to know you know their name, especially if it’s a good one.
If you can’t find their name anywhere, online or offline, ‘Dear Hiring Manager’ is enough. Madam or Sir is too outdated.

Make it short and sweet.
No one has time to read an essay. Three paragraphs that cover ½ a page are enough. Max 4.
The first paragraph introduces you and your beliefs. Here, you should also mention where you heard about the job opportunity, whether it’s from a friend or a website listing.
The second is about all about the company. What’s special about them? Why did you pick them?
It’s also important to mention what you can bring to the company before you conclude your job application or cold pitch.

Have a great opening statement.
Just like in an article, the first sentence is always the hook. I’m sure the hiring manager has read enough job application letters that read “My name is .. and I’m applying for …”
Instead of being plain 'NAME', stand out with a unique opening statement that brings you to life. It should also relate to the job you’re applying for.
EXAMPLE: “I have always wanted to support others to realize their writing dreams, just as my own mother does for me.”
Now the person on the other side feels like they’re talking to a human being, and not just another job applicant. One point to you.

Do your research.
With enough facts, you will have lots to talk about in the second paragraph. Pick out the company’s values and mission . Why did you choose them? Do you have a history with them? Is there something they do that you like?
Now, this makes them feel special; it’s all about your employer. And how would you feel if I said you inspire me?
Talk about yourself (cleverly).
This is the part most of us are familiar with. We love to list all our hard-earned skills and high-end achievements. We sell ourselves with the best adjectives we can find on the internet.
But before you list anything you need to know what qualities the company wants. This is why you should spend ample time reading the vacancy letter. Once you’ve understood the ideal qualifications, address them in the third paragraph.

Have a smart conclusion.
Once you’ve talked about what you like about the company and what you have already done that relates to their business, it’s time to end it well. The standard format is usually to thank the hiring manager and direct them to your CV. 
This is your final pitch, so make it memorable. What I did here was to express my enthusiasm in joining their humble company. I reiterated their vision to show that I was ready to serve them in the way they wanted.
